Documenting my LeetCode journey


`P.S. Although the runtime ranking was relatively low, this was mainly due to syntactic differences rather than flaws in the algorithm itself. Since I am currently focused on quickly learning data structures and algorithms, I will not optimize for runtime at this stage. However, I will ensure that the time complexity of my solution matches that of the optimal approach.`
