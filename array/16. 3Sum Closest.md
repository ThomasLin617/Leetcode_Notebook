# 16. 3Sum Closest
## code
```python
class Solution:
    def threeSumClosest(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        nums.sort()
        minum = 100000000
        for i in range(len(nums)-2):
            if i > 0 and nums[i] == nums[i-1]:
                continue
            j = i+1
            k = len(nums) - 1
            while j < k:
                summ = nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k]
                if abs(summ - target) < abs(minum - target):
                    minum = summ
                if summ == target:
                    minum = target
                    break
                if summ > target:
                    k -= 1
                    if j < k and nums[k] == nums[k+1]:
                        k -= 1
                if summ < target:
                    j += 1
                    if j < k and nums[j] == nums[j-1]:
                        j += 1
        return minum

## idea
This problem is another typical three-pointer question, with an approach similar to the classic 3Sum problem. The main focus is still on managing the i index inside the for-loop along with the two pointers j and k, especially when it comes to handling duplicates and edge cases. When solving this type of problem, it's important to keep track of what each variable represents. Simply copying the previous line without understanding the logic can easily lead to confusion and mistakes.

P.S. Although the runtime ranking was relatively low, this was mainly due to syntactic differences rather than flaws in the algorithm itself. Since I am currently focused on quickly learning data structures and algorithms, I will not optimize for runtime at this stage. However, I will ensure that the time complexity of my solution matches that of the optimal approach.
