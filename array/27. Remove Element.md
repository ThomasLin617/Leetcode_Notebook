# 27. Remove Element
## code
```python
class Solution:
    def removeElement(self, nums: List[int], val: int) -> int:
        i = 0
        for j in range(0, len(nums)):
            if nums[j] != val:
                nums[i] = nums[j]
                i += 1
        return i 
```
## idea
Same as `26. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array `

P.S. Although the runtime ranking was relatively low, this was mainly due to syntactic differences rather than flaws in the algorithm itself. Since I am currently focused on quickly learning data structures and algorithms, I will not optimize for runtime at this stage. However, I will ensure that the time complexity of my solution matches that of the optimal approach.
