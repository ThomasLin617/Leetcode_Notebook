# 11. Container With Most Water
## first-thought solution
### code
```python
class Solution:
    def maxArea(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        max = 0
        for i in range(len(height)-1):
            for j in range(i+1, len(height)):
                area = (j-i) * min(height[i], height[j])
                if area >= max:
                    max = area
        return max

```
## optimized solution
```python
class Solution:
    def maxArea(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        left = 0
        right = len(height)-1
        maxarea = 0
        while(left<right):
            area = (right-left) * min(height[left], height[right])
            if area > maxarea:
                maxarea = area
            if min(height[left], height[right]) == height[left]:
                left += 1
            elif min(height[left], height[right]) == height[right]:
                right -= 1
        return maxarea
```
## idea
I first considered the brute-force approach: use two nested for loops to check every pair, compute the area as (j − i) × min(height[i], height[j]), and update the maximum value. While this passes the sample tests, it times out on submission.
Remembering the two-pointer technique, I placed one pointer at each end of the array, calculated the current area, and then always moved the pointer at the shorter bar. After each move, I recalculated and updated the maximum area. This strategy runs in O(n) time and avoids the time-limit issue.
