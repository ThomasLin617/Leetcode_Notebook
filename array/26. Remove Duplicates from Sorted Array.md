# 26. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array
## code
```python
class Solution:
    def removeDuplicates(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        i = 0
        check = 0
        while check < len(nums):
            while check < len(nums) and nums[i] == nums[check]:
                check += 1
            if check < len(nums):
                i += 1
                nums[i] = nums[check]
        return i + 1
```
## idea
The goal of this problem is to move all distinct elements to the front of the array and return the number of unique values. By comparing elements one by one and writing new values into the array when a difference is found, we can remove duplicates in $O(n)$ time. Although this is considered an easy-level problem, I ended up spending more time on it than expected. The main reason was my lack of familiarity with boundary checks, especially the fact that Python’s range function is a left-inclusive, right-exclusive interval. Once you fully understand the boundary behavior, the problem itself is not difficult—but careful implementation is key to avoid subtle mistakes.

P.S. Although the runtime ranking was relatively low, this was mainly due to syntactic differences rather than flaws in the algorithm itself. Since I am currently focused on quickly learning data structures and algorithms, I will not optimize for runtime at this stage. However, I will ensure that the time complexity of my solution matches that of the optimal approach.
