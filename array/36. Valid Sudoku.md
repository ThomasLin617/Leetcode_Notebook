# 36. Valid Sudoku
## code
```python
class Solution:
    def isValidSudoku(self, board: List[List[str]]) -> bool:
        row = defaultdict(set)
        col = defaultdict(set)
        box = defaultdict(set)

        for r in range(9):
            for c in range(9):
                if board[r][c] == ".":
                    continue
                if board[r][c] in row[r] or board[r][c] in col[c] or board[r][c] in box[(r // 3, c // 3)]:
                    return False
                row[r].add(board[r][c])
                col[c].add(board[r][c])
                box[(r // 3, c // 3)].add(board[r][c])
        return True
```
## idea
This problem requires checking whether a given 9x9 Sudoku board is valid. The main idea is to set up a separate array for each of the validation rules: rows, columns, and 3x3 boxes. Then, we iterate through every element in the board and check whether the number has already appeared in the corresponding row, column, or box. If we find no duplicates after the iteration, we can conclude that the board is valid.
Although the approach is straightforward, I learned how to use defaultdict and set effectively in this problem. These data structures made it easy and efficient to store and check for existing numbers. Additionally, the way to index the 3x3 boxes using (r // 3, c // 3) was a neat trick I picked up from the example, and I think it's a useful pattern that I can apply in future problems as well.

P.S. Although the runtime ranking was relatively low, this was mainly due to syntactic differences rather than flaws in the algorithm itself. Since I am currently focused on quickly learning data structures and algorithms, I will not optimize for runtime at this stage. However, I will ensure that the time complexity of my solution matches that of the optimal approach.
