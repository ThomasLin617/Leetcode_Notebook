# Two Sum
## code(optimized)
```python
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        hashmap = {}
        for i, n in enumerate(nums):
            implete = target - n
            if implete in hashmap:
                return [hashmap[implete], i]
            hashmap[n] = i
```
## idea
The core idea is to leverage a hash table. Since we must return the original indices, sorting is not an option. By storing each element we have already examined in a dictionary and comparing the current element to its complement, we can retrieve matches in O(1) average time. This reduces the overall time complexity from O(nÂ²) to O(n).
