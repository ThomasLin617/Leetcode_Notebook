# 17. Letter Combinations of a Phone Number
## code
```python
class Solution:
    def letterCombinations(self, digits: str) -> List[str]:
        dic = {
            '2' : 'abc',
            '3' : 'def',
            '4' : 'ghi',
            '5' : 'jkl',
            '6' : 'mno',
            '7' : 'pqrs',
            '8' : 'tuv',
            '9' : 'wxyz',


        }
        if not digits:
            return []
        
        def backtrack(indx, comb):
            if indx == len(digits):
                res.append(comb[:])
                return
            for letter in dic[digits[indx]]:
                backtrack(indx+1, comb+letter)

        res = []
        backtrack(0, "")
        return res
```
## idea
This problem requires using a hash map and the backtracking technique to explore all possible combinations.
What I learned from this problem is one way to utilize a dictionary by recursively traversing its values.
In each recursive call, a for-loop iterates over all the characters in the current value, and the result is passed to the next level.
Once the length of the current combination matches the input length, it is added to the result list.
I believe that with more practice, Iâ€™ll be able to fully grasp how to work with dictionaries effectively.
