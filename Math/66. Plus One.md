# 66. Plus One
## code
```python
class Solution:
    def plusOne(self, digits: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        for i in range(len(digits)-1, -1, -1):
            digits[i] = (digits[i] + 1) % 10
            if digits[i]:
                return digits
        return [1] + digits
```
## idea
The goal of this problem is to implement the logic of incrementing an integer represented as an array of digits.I used the method that starts from the end of the array: increase the last digit by one, and if it becomes 10, set it to 0 and carry over to the next digit on the left. If itâ€™s not 10, we can return the result immediately. Time complexity is O(n) in the worst case, and space complexity is O(1) unless we need to insert a new digit at the front.
