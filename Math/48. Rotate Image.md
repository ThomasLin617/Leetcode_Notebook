# 48. Rotate Image
## code
```python
class Solution:
    def rotate(self, matrix: List[List[int]]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify matrix in-place instead.
        """
        size = len(matrix)
        mid = size // 2
        for i in range(mid):
            for j in range(size):
                matrix[i][j], matrix[size - i - 1][j] = matrix[size - i - 1][j], matrix[i][j]

        for i in range(size):
            for j in range(size):
                if i > j:
                    matrix[i][j], matrix[j][i] = matrix[j][i], matrix[i][j]

```
## idea
The goal of this problem is to **rotate a square matrix 90 degrees clockwise in-place**.
At first, I wasn't sure how to approach it, but after understanding the general idea, I realized that the rotation can be achieved by first **flipping the matrix vertically**, and then **transposing it along the main diagonal**.

This approach makes the implementation very clean and avoids the need for extra space.

What I learned from this problem is a useful matrix transformation technique — using simple flip operations to perform a complex rotation.
###  Complexity:
* **Time complexity:** O(N²), since every element is processed once
* **Space complexity:** O(1), as the operation is done in-place without extra memory
