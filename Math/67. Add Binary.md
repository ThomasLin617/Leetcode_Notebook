# 67. Add Binary
## code
```python
class Solution:
    def addBinary(self, a: str, b: str) -> str:
        carry = 0
        res = []
        a, b = a.zfill(max(len(a), len(b))), b.zfill(max(len(a), len(b)))
        for i in range(len(a) - 1, -1, -1):
            total = carry + int(a[i]) + int(b[i])
            res.append(str(total % 2))
            carry = total // 2
        if carry:
            res.append('1')

        return ''.join(reversed(res))
```
## idea
This problem is a simple binary addition. We just need to compute the carry and the digit sum at each position to get the correct result. However, my initial code was a bit messy. It included:

* Repeated string prepending like `res = str(...) + res`, which is inefficient;
* Redundant `if/else` logic to pad zeros;
* Verbose carry check using `if summ >= 2`;
* An early return inside the loop, which made the structure inconsistent.

Later, I learned several clean code techniques:

* Using `zfill()` to pad both strings in one line;
* Building the result with a list and joining it with `''.join(reversed(res))`, which is both faster and cleaner;
* Simplifying the carry logic using `carry = total // 2` instead of a conditional;
* Keeping a single return statement at the end to maintain a clean structure.

These improvements helped me write cleaner and more efficient code.

The time complexity is O(n) and space complexity is also O(n), where n is the length of the longer input string.
