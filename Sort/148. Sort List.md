# 148. Sort List
## code
```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def sortList(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        if not head or not head.next:
            return head
        slow = head
        fast = head.next
        while fast and fast.next:
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next
        mid = slow.next

        return self.merge(left, right)

        curr = dummy
        while l and r:
            if l.val < r.val:
                curr.next = l
                l = l.next
            else:
                curr.next = r
                r = r.next

## idea
The goal of this problem is to sort a linked list. Initially, I used the insertion sort approach, where whenever the order was incorrect, I scanned from the head until I found the correct insertion position, then inserted the node there. While this method worked correctly, it timed out on large test cases because insertion sort has a time complexity of $O(n^2)$ in the worst case (completely reversed order). To improve efficiency, I switched to the merge sort approach, which recursively splits the linked list, sorts each half, and then merges them. This reduces the time complexity to $O(n \log n)$ and has a space complexity of $O(\log n)$ due to the recursion stack. Through this problem, I learned how to implement merge sort recursively and improved my skills in efficiently sorting linked lists.
