# 75. Sort Colors
## code
```python
class Solution:
    def sortColors(self, nums: List[int]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.
        """
        low, mid, high = 0, 0, len(nums) - 1
        while mid <= high:
            if nums[mid] == 0:
                nums[mid], nums[low] = nums[low], nums[mid]
                mid += 1
                low += 1
            elif nums[mid] == 1:
                mid += 1
            elif nums[mid] == 2:
                nums[mid], nums[high] = nums[high], nums[mid]
                high -= 1

```
## idea
The goal of this problem is to sort an array containing only the integers 0, 1, and 2 (representing red, white, and blue) **in-place** without using any built-in sort function.

I used the **Dutch National Flag algorithm**, which maintains three regions:

* Left side (`0 ~ low-1`) stores 0s
* Middle (`low ~ mid-1`) stores 1s
* Right side (`high+1 ~ n-1`) stores 2s

The `mid` pointer scans the array, and each value is placed into its correct region by swapping when necessary. The condition `mid <= high` is crucial because when `mid == high`, there is still one unprocessed element.

### Complexity:

* **Time:** O(n)
* **Space:** O(1)
