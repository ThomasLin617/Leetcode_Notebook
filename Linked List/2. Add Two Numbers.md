# 2. Add Two Numbers
## code
```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def addTwoNumbers(self, l1: Optional[ListNode], l2: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        dummy = ListNode()
        res = dummy
        carry = total = 0
        while l1 or l2 or carry:
            total = carry
            if l1:
                total += l1.val
                l1 = l1.next
            if l2:
                total += l2.val
                l2 = l2.next
            carry = total // 10
            dummy.next = ListNode(total % 10)
            dummy = dummy.next

        return res.next
```
## idea
The goal of this problem is to add two linked lists, where each node represents a single digit.
The logic is essentially the same as performing vertical (column-wise) addition.
This problem helped me become more familiar with linked list operations, especially the use of a `dummy` node as a virtual head to simplify the construction of the result list.
Each resulting digit is appended to `dummy.next` one by one.
I also learned the common pattern of using `total` and `carry`: initializing each iteration with `total = carry`, then adding the digit values — a clean and practical approach.

**Complexity:**

* **Time Complexity:** O(max(m, n)) — We traverse the longer of the two linked lists
* **Space Complexity:** O(max(m, n)) — A new linked list is created to store the result
