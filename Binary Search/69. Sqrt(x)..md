# 69. Sqrt(x)
## code
```py
class Solution:
    def mySqrt(self, x: int) -> int:
        if x < 2:
            return x
        left = 1
        right = x
        while left <= right:
            mid = (left + right) // 2
            if mid ** 2 == x:
                return mid
            if mid ** 2 < x:
                left = mid + 1
            if mid ** 2 > x:
                right = mid - 1

        return right
```
## idea
The goal of this problem is to find the integer part of the square root, which means finding a `res` such that `res^2 <= x` and `(res + 1)^2 > x`. This is a basic binary search problem, but since it's my first time implementing binary search, I missed some important detailsâ€”for example, we must exclude `mid` itself when updating the search range, or it may lead to an infinite loop. Also, when the loop ends, `left` becomes greater than `right`, so to return the correct integer square root, we should return `right`.

The time complexity is O(log x) because the search range is halved in each iteration.
The space complexity is O(1) since only a constant amount of variables is used.
