```python

## idea
The goal of this problem is to determine whether the string `s` matches a given pattern, with the main difficulty being the `*` character, which represents zero or more occurrences of the preceding element. This is my first time solving a dynamic programming (DP) problem of this kind. Previously, my understanding of DP was limited to problems like "using the fewest number of coins to make up a given amount." Since this problem is categorized as Hard, my initial attempts—completely unrelated to DP—failed obviously. So I referred to a standard DP solution.

Even after reading the solution, the DP approach still felt overwhelming at first. The core concept lies in the dp\[]\[] array. I had never solved problems that relied on previous results to deduce the current state, so I instinctively thought of it as matching characters at the same index in `s` and `p`. That misunderstanding made the code unreadable to me. Later, I realized that `dp[i][j]` represents whether the first `i` characters of `s` match the first `j` characters of `p`. It’s not just comparing `s[i]` and `p[j]`, but rather building on previously computed results. That’s the true nature of DP.

Another part I didn’t understand was how `*` could affect so many previous values. It turns out that it’s because of the nested for-loops: when using `*` to "consume" characters in `s`, we move the pointer in `s` while keeping the `*` in `p` fixed, allowing it to continue matching. This process is handled through recursion-like propagation, not direct index matching.

Once I understood these concepts, the rest became much clearer. The remaining challenge was handling index boundaries. Since `dp[][]` includes the match status for empty strings, the indices don’t align exactly with `s[]` and `p[]`, and that caused some confusion. I also occasionally mixed up `i` and `j`, but those are minor issues. I now understand the big picture, and I believe with a few more problems, this will become second nature.
