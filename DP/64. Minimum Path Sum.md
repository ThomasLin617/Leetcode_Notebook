# 64. Minimum Path Sum
## code
```python
class Solution:
    def minPathSum(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        rows = len(grid)
        cols = len(grid[0])
        dp = [[0] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
        dp[0][0] = grid[0][0]
        for i in range(1, cols):
            dp[0][i] = dp[0][i-1] + grid[0][i]

        for i in range(1, rows):
            dp[i][0] = dp[i-1][0] + grid[i][0]

        for i in range(1, rows):
            for j in range(1, cols):
                dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) + grid[i][j]

        return dp[-1][-1]         
```

    def minPathSum(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        rows = len(grid)
        cols = len(grid[0])
        dp = [0] * cols
        dp[0] = grid[0][0]

        for j in range(1, cols):
            dp[j] = dp[j - 1] + grid[0][j]

        for i in range(1, rows):
            dp[0] += grid[i][0]
            for j in range(1, cols):
                dp[j] = min(dp[j], dp[j - 1]) + grid[i][j]

        return dp[-1]
```
## idea
The goal of this problem is to find the path from the top-left to the bottom-right corner of the grid with the minimum sum.
Since I'm still not very familiar with using a 1D array, I started with a 2D DP array to store the states.
I first initialized the first row and first column, then iterated through each cell, taking the minimum of the top and left values and adding the current grid value.
Finally, I returned the value at the bottom-right corner as the answer.
After completing that, I rewrote the solution using a space-optimized version with `O(n)` space.

**Complexity Analysis:**

* **Time:** O(m × n)
* **Space:** O(n) (optimized from O(m × n))
