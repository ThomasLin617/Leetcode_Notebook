# 6. Zigzag Conversion
## code
```python
class Solution:
    def convert(self, s: str, numRows: int) -> str:
        if numRows == 1 or numRows >= len(s):
            return s
        index, d = 0, 1
        board = [[]for _ in range(numRows)]
        anstr = ""
        for char in s:
            board[index].append(char)
            if index == 0:
                d = 1
            elif index == numRows - 1:
                d = -1
            index += d

        for i in range(numRows):
            board[i] = ''.join(board[i])

        return ''.join(board)
```
## idea
This problem requires converting a string into a Z-shaped pattern. At first glance, it seems like a simple task involving index manipulation and direction switchingâ€”placing characters into a 2D array in the correct order based on the current direction, then merging the rows into a single string to return.

However, through this problem, I learned two important Python techniques.
The first is using `[[] for _ in range(numRows)]` to initialize an empty 2D list.
The second is using `board[i] = ''.join(board[i])` to merge a list of characters into a single string.

These techniques have improved my flexibility and confidence when working with arrays in Python.
