# 12. Integer to Roman
## code
```python
class Solution:
    def intToRoman(self, num: int) -> str:
        numsym = [
            (1000, 'M'), (900, 'CM'), (500, 'D'), (400, 'CD'),
            (100, 'C'), (90, 'XC'), (50, 'L'), (40, 'XL'), (10, 'X'),
            (9, 'IX'), (5, 'V'), (4, 'IV'), (1, 'I')
        ]
        i = 0
        count  = 0
        ans = ""
        for v, s in numsym:
            if num == 0:
                break
            count = num // v
            if count == 0:
                continue
            ans += s * count
            num = num % (count * v)

        return ans
```
## idea
The goal of this problem is to convert an Arabic numeral into a Roman numeral. This problem isn't very difficult as long as you understand the rules of Roman numerals, you can apply a greedy approach to solve it. However, through this problem, I gained a deeper understanding of how tuples work, which will be useful for solving problems in the future.
