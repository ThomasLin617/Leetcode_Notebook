# 8. String to Integer (atoi)
## code
```python
class Solution:
    def myAtoi(self, s: str) -> int:
        s = s.strip()
        if not s:
            return 0
        sign = 1
        i = 0
        ans = 0
        if s[0] == '+':
            sign = 1
            i += 1
        elif s[0] == '-':
            sign = -1
            i += 1
        while i < len(s) and s[i].isdigit():
            ans = ans* 10 + int(s[i])
            i += 1
        if sign * ans > 2**31 - 1:
            return 2**31 - 1
        if sign * ans < -2**31:
            return -2**31
        return ans*sign
```
## idea
The goal of this problem is to convert a string into an integer. While the logic is straightforward, it requires careful handling of the string. Through this problem, I learned how to use `strip()` and `isdigit()`, which will be very helpful for future problems.

During the initial implementation, I overlooked the part of the problem that required handling integer overflow, so I spent some time reviewing solutions to understand how to properly handle the edge cases.
