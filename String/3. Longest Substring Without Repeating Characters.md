# 3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
## code
```python
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:
        check = set()
        left = 0
        ans = 0
        for right in range(len(s)):
            while s[right] in check:
                check.remove(s[left])
                left += 1

            check.add(s[right])
            ans = max(ans, right-left+1)
        return ans
```
## idea
This is my first time solving a problem using the sliding window approach. The goal of this problem is to find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters. The idea is to maintain two pointers, left and right. Initially, the right pointer moves continuously from position 0 to the end, while the left pointer stays still. Each time the right pointer moves, the character it points to is added into a set, and the size of the window is compared with the current maximum. If the window size exceeds the current maximum, it is updated accordingly. When the right pointer encounters a repeated character, the left pointer moves forward to the right until no repeated characters remain in the window. Since the right pointer scans the string only once, and each character is added or removed from the set at most once by the left pointer, the overall complexity is $O(n)$.
