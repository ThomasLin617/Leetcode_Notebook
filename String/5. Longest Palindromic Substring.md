# 5. Longest Palindromic Substring
## code
```python
class Solution:
    def longestPalindrome(self, s: str) -> str:
        maxlen = 0
        maxstr = ""
        for i in range(len(s)):
            left = i
            right = i
            while(left >= 0 and right < len(s) and s[left] == s[right]):
                left -= 1
                right += 1
            lens = right - left - 1
            maxlen = max(lens, maxlen)
            if max(lens, maxlen) == lens:
                maxstr = s[left+1 : right]
        
        for i in range (len(s)):
            left = i
            right = i + 1
            
            while(left>=0 and right < len(s) and s[left] == s[right]):
                left -= 1
                right += 1
            lens = right - left - 1
            maxlen = max(lens, maxlen)
            if maxlen == lens:
                maxstr = s[left+1 : right]
        return maxstr

## idea
This problem looks simple at first glance, but it's actually easy to make mistakes. The goal is to find the longest palindromic substring within a given string. I started by implementing the center expansion method for odd-length palindromes, and it worked fine. However, once I added the logic for even-length palindromes, bugs started to appear.

The issues I encountered included slicing boundary errors. Initially, I tried using a counter to track how many steps the pointers moved and then calculated the length, but I found that this approach made the logic more error-prone. It's more reliable to directly calculate the length using the difference between the right and left pointers. Fewer variables also lead to fewer mistakes.

Additionally, I initially forgot to consider the even-length cases entirely. In the future, I should make sure to consider all possible cases before jumping into implementation.
