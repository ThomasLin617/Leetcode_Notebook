# 14. Longest Common Prefix
## code
```python
class Solution:
    def longestCommonPrefix(self, strs: List[str]) -> str:
        prefix = strs[0]
        prefixlen = len(prefix)
        for s in strs[1:]:
            while s[0:prefixlen] != prefix:
                prefixlen -= 1
                prefix = prefix[0: prefixlen]
        return prefix
```
## idea
The goal of this problem is to find the longest common prefix.
The main idea is to start by setting the prefix to the first string,
then gradually shorten it until it matches the beginning of the next string.
Repeat this process for all strings, and finally return the result.
