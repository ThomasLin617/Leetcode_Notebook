# 39. Combination Sum
## code
```python
class Solution:
    def combinationSum(self, candidates: List[int], target: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        ans = []

        def make(index: int, comb: List[int], total: int):
            if total == target:
                ans.append(comb[:])
                return
            if total > target or index >= len(candidates):
                return
            
            comb.append(candidates[index])
            make(index, comb, total+candidates[index])
            comb.pop()

            make(index+1, comb, total)

        make(0, [], 0)
        return ans
```
## idea
This was my first time solving a backtracking problem. The basic idea is to break the solution into decision points: whether to choose the current index's number or not. If I choose it, I add it to the combination; if I don't, I move to the next index. If the path fails—meaning the total exceeds the target or the index goes out of bounds—I backtrack to the previous step.

Besides learning the overall backtracking logic, I also realized that when a variable affects deeper levels of recursion, it’s better to pass it as a function parameter. This keeps the code cleaner and prevents it from affecting other branches of recursion.

I also learned that using comb.append() together with comb.pop() is crucial. For problems like this that follow a binary tree structure of “choose or not choose,” this approach helps safely reuse the same combination list without causing bugs.
